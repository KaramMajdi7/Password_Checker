# Password_Checker

This program was made with python, using requests library and hashlib library to hash the password,
it works by giving the program as many passwords you want, and then it will return if this password was 
found or not, and the I designed a GUI using Tkinter library to get the password in the question field fromthe user and the
user will click on the ASK button and at the test area the output will be printed that if the password was found or not, and
here is a quick look on the program:

 First thing I will put a password in the question field:
 
 ![pass2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74671857/140299654-6e5181f9-ac04-46a6-8257-0200f4d9bc1d.JPG)

Then I will click the ASK button to print the output:

And at last I will click on the clear button to clear the output to check on another password:
